3)Generalization: Converting a subclass type into a superclass type is called Generalization it is also called as a up casting
 up cating  is safe because the classes will become more general.
 specialized: Converting a superclass type into a subclass type is called specialized. A class which is very particular and
 states the specific details. 
4)a. A class declared as final can't be extended

b.final calsses:Final class cannot be inherited by any subclass
  java.lang.string
  java.lang.math
  
c.Delegation can be an alternative to inheritance. Delegation means that you use an object 
of another class as an instance variable, and forward messages to the instance  

5)java.util.collection
 comaparble and compator
 performs the sorting in ascending order
 
6)linked list 
 it is node based,it slower to read,but faster to manipualtion. they store elements in memory
 Arraylist 
 it is indexed based,it is faster to read,but slower to manipualtion 
 
7)Listiterator 
 list iterator can  be indexed base.
 iterator
 it can use list and set 
 iterator can not be indexed base
 
 8)it helps to remove the client-side typecasting by enabling you to return a subtype of the overridden method's actual return type.
 
 9)A Memory Leak is a situation where there are objects present in the heap that are no longer used, 
 but the garbage collector is unable to remove them from memory, and they're unnecessarily maintained.
 A memory leak is bad because it blocks memory resources and degrades system performance over time.
 
 10)Static polymorphism  another name is compile time Polymorphusm,
 it is a type of polymorphism that collects the information to call a method during compile time.
 method signture checks the compile time polymorphusm.
 Dynamic polymorphism  another name is runtime polymorphism,
 it is a type of polymorphism that collects information to call a method at run time. 
 jvm checks the runtime polymorphism.
 
 11)by using Encapsulation
